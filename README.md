# A Song A Day - Backend
So this is the backend for A Song A Day web application.

Has REST APIs for the following:
* **Publish YouTube Video:** Takes a youtube video and log in credentials as parameters and 1. Posts it on Facebook and 2. Adds it to a playlist.

Uses: Django. Why? Easiest to build a REST api using that.
